# VoidScape
These is my game i made for a school project. It's name is VoidScape. Fast-pase 2D platformer.
Used libs and tools: SDL3, SDL3_image, SDL3_mixer, glad, OpenGL 4.6 Core,  glm 1.0.1, nlohmannjson, freetype. If you want to compile the project you'll need to install and link these libs yourself.
To run the game you'll need Visual C++ Redistributables (and you probably already have them), but if you don't - install them.
